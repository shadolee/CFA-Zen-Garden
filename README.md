# CFA-Zen-Garden
Style a html page using css.

The html came from the [CSS Zen Garden: The Beauty of Web Design](http://www.csszengarden.com/) page. 

This project required using a pre-written HMTL file and using a separate .css file to syle that page. This was the first time using css in the very early stages of the course.
